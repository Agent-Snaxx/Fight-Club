# Fight Club
**Weaponized AGI BOT  **

- **3.5 year journey to build 3 things fueled with extreeme predjudice, revenge to fight back against the system
  1. Design a weapon ('s) to fight on the same feild in the same arena angainst the same players but bend the rukes in the users favor
  2. Fintech Quality is old, dusty and paywalled- Retail quality is built on depracted code
   2a. Build with todays tech using the language AI is built on 2025 (agent is not a real framework for fintech)
   2b. LLM at a local console level (ORCA Oversight Regulator Comptroller Authoruty) for the entire ecosytem oversight and dynamic paramter manager accross frameworks
   2c. No backtesting, no paper trading, no simmulated trading - 100% realtime live testing ONLY - real money - real trades - built for stagbility (TIME STAMPED LOGS)
  3. ??? to do with your capital?   MyPyFi---waste of breath to explain get your GPT to in depth summarize MyPyFi then donate if you managed not to shit yourself
   3a.  swapBot is a base framework shared by all bot on top an admin layer for agentOnly -remix exact build (run it throught the ringer---llm and i did on all test nets)
   3b. SAM - simulated asset manager does a full asset breakdown from yfinance (in testing)
   3c. Parameter Library----use your favaorite all time strategies and tune them by exposing their parameter into the already exposed parameter in swapBot

$$$$ the catch do what was not extended to me - FIGHT against the crypto way ----the closed door----too high skill level---provide FIRST MOVER code  
i started this journey unemployed carpenter (still) lucky for me i had an advantage over other because i clearly undesrtsood Python is a large Snake of South America 

    99% percent of all traders get wrecked so ask yourself are you the 1%
    MOM is one the highest rated forms of swap strategies ever----combine them - tune them and automate all -- 

- powered by donation - eth /stables and tell a friend --   0xEf6C8c5C0368783A2EEe54a9f104861d29F72159
- USE IT- OWN IT- FORK iT- FUCK it -WRECK IT - RESET IT - DONATE - REPEAT

- Repo Notes:
- MIT transparent not available for sale or resale
- relevant framework with todays tech to swap with confidence
- stop the crypto beatdowns and fight back  
--
- battle tested with match logs and more logs and charts
- designed break even as neutral base use the tech to make it yours
- NOT MY BUG -------Fix your own bugs.
