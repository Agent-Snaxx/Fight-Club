2. Optimize EMA span: Since EMA_span is responsible for detecting trends, adjusting this parameter can help the bot identify trends more accurately. You can try increasing or decreasing the EMA_span value to see if it improves the bot's ability to capture profitable trends.

3. Implement risk management strategies: One possible reason for the negative PnL and low win rate could be inadequate risk management. Consider implementing stop-loss orders, position sizing based on account balance or volatility, and profit-taking strategies to protect profits and minimize losses.

4. Backtest and analyze results: Before making any changes to the bot's parameters, it's crucial to backtest them thoroughly using historical data. Analyze the results to understand how changes
